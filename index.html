    <h3>Methods to chill</h3>
    <h5>One of the best methods for laughing is breathing itself, which can relax everything from the muscles of the body to the mind. In this way, we have separated the best ways of breathing for the occasion:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Abdominal breathing</b></li>
        <p>In this technique, try to inhale and exhale, moving only your abdomen, calmly and deeply. You can place your hand over it to feel the movement and see if you are doing it correctly.</p>
        
        <li><b>Square Breathing (Sama Vritti)</b></li>
        <p>With Hindu origins, Sama Vritti requires a four-second pause with each breath and inspiration. Inhale slowly through your nose for a count of four, pause for 4 seconds, exhale through your mouth for a count of four and pause for another 4 seconds. In the end, it's as if you are forming a breathing square, with 4 seconds in each step.</p>
        
        <li><b>Lengthened exhalation</b></li>
        <p>Similar to the previous technique, in elongated breathing you must inhale through your nose for 4 seconds and then exhale through your mouth for twice as long (in this case, 8 seconds). Training exhalation activates our parasympathetic nervous system and influences our ability to relax.</p>
        
        <li><b>Progressive relaxation</b></li>
        <p>This breathing is extremely recommended to do before bed, as it promotes body relaxation. Breathe slowly, contract and relax some muscle groups in your body for three seconds. You will notice an increase in the feeling of well-being with each sequence</p>
        
        <li><b>Alternating nostrils</b></li>
        <p>Last but not least, the alternating nostril breathing technique allows you to improve your concentration and relax. Using your index finger, inhale through one nostril and exhale through the other. Then do it again alternating.</p>
    </ul>
